# Comparing GPT and Bigram Language Models

## 1. Introduction
Language models are essential in NLP for text generation, completion, and understanding. Two commonly used models are:
- **Bigram Language Model**: A simple probabilistic model based on two-word sequences.
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: A deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture, capable of understanding long-range dependencies.

## 2. Bigram Language Model
### **Concept**
- The bigram model predicts the next word **based only on the previous word**.
- Uses a probability table learned from text corpus.

### **Implementation (Python Code)**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class BigramLanguageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.token_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, vocab_size)
    
    def forward(self, idx, targets=None):
        logits = self.token_embedding_table(idx)  # (B, T, C)
        if targets is None:
            return logits, None
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, logits.shape[-1]), targets.view(-1))
        return logits, loss
    
    def generate(self, idx, max_new_tokens):
        for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
            logits, _ = self(idx)
            probs = F.softmax(logits[:, -1, :], dim=-1)
            idx_next = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
            idx = torch.cat((idx, idx_next), dim=1)
        return idx
```
### **![
1. Understanding the Axes
X-axis (Steps): Represents the number of training iterations (or steps) the model has undergone.

Y-axis (Loss): Represents the loss value (typically cross-entropy loss), which measures how well the model is learning.

2. Interpretation of the Curves
Blue Line (Train Loss): Shows how the loss decreases as the model is trained.

Red Dashed Line (Validation Loss): Represents how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

3. Observations
Sharp Drop at the Beginning: The loss is very high initially (around 5.0) but drops steeply within the first few hundred steps. This is expected as the model quickly learns basic patterns.

Stabilization: After about 1000 steps, the loss stabilizes at around 2.5, meaning the model is no longer significantly improving.

Minimal Overfitting: The training and validation losses remain close to each other, which means the model generalizes well and is not overfitting.](image.png)**


### **Advantages**
✅ **Simple and computationally cheap**  
✅ **Easy to train**  

### **Disadvantages**
❌ **Ignores long-term dependencies**  
❌ **Fails to generate coherent long text**

## 3. GPT Language Model
### **Concept**
- Uses **transformer architecture** with multi-head self-attention.
- Learns contextual relationships between words over long distances.
- Can generate high-quality, coherent text.

### **Implementation (Python Code)**
```python
class GPTLanguageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, n_embd, n_head, n_layer, block_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.token_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_embd)
        self.position_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(block_size, n_embd)
        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(*[Block(n_embd, n_head) for _ in range(n_layer)])
        self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(n_embd)
        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_embd, vocab_size)
    
    def forward(self, idx, targets=None):
        B, T = idx.shape
        tok_emb = self.token_embedding_table(idx)
        pos_emb = self.position_embedding_table(torch.arange(T))
        x = tok_emb + pos_emb
        x = self.blocks(x)
        x = self.ln_f(x)
        logits = self.lm_head(x)
        
        if targets is None:
            return logits, None
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, logits.shape[-1]), targets.view(-1))
        return logits, loss
```
### **![
The x-axis (Iteration) represents the number of training steps taken.

The y-axis (Loss) represents the loss value, which measures how well the model's predictions match the actual values.

The curve shows a decreasing trend in loss, indicating that the model is improving its performance as training progresses.

The scatter points suggest some fluctuations, which could be due to batch-based training (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).](Screenshot (21).png)**

### **Advantages**
✅ **Captures long-range dependencies**  
✅ **Generates more coherent and context-aware text**  
✅ **Scalable to large datasets and pre-training**  

### **Disadvantages**
❌ **Computationally expensive**  
❌ **Requires large amounts of training data**

## 5. Conclusion
- If you need a **simple, fast** model for small-scale tasks, **Bigram** is useful.
- If you need **state-of-the-art performance** for text generation, **GPT** is the better choice.

For real-world applications like **chatbots, text generation, and NLP research**, **GPT** is the preferred model due to its ability to generate **coherent, meaningful** text.
